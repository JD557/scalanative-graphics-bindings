# Scala Native Code for the OpenGL Red Book

This is an implementation of most examples from the [OpenGL classic programming
guide (the red book)](http://www.glprogramming.com/red/) in Scala Native using
the OpenGL bindings. There is one file per chapter, with potentially more than
one main function that runs the example. We use SDL2 instead of GLUT for
managing the window and events.
